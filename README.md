# Weather App

This is a Weather application that will search only by city names. This App is built in React with Redux and is dependent on the openweathermaps.org api. This is the first Redux application I ever built and took some time to get my head around the concept. Now that I have a grasp on how to use the application, I have fine tuned this application to respond to errors etc. I still want to add some machine learning to be able to choose a specific city/state. 

## Installing
  ```
  npm install
  ```
## Start 
  ```
  npm run start
  ```
### Deployment
  ```
  Deployed using Heroku for development
  ```
### Notes
  ```
  Running bcrypt, currently there is a dependency that has vulnerabilities for an older version. Version 3.0.0 works fine but you need node@10.6.0
  ```
